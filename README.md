### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago Silva and I'm from Brazil :brazil: . I have been working as a front-end developer since 2015 and I am currently studying software engineering at MetrÃ³pole Digital Institute at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. I have my space on GitHub, where I make it as my personal code lab, sharing many things there :)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS :electron:

âš¡ Fun fact: I love photography and I am also a social and documentary photographer. Check out the link below [photographic portfolio](https://thiagosilva.alboompro.com).

ðŸ“« Would you like to reach me?
